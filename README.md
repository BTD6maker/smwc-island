# SMWC Island
SMWC Island (or smwci) is a community collaborative ROMhack of Yoshi's Island (SNES).

[Please consult the SMWC Island forum for additional information.](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewforum&f=6424)

# How to Build the ROM
The ROM can be completely built from scratch, as each level's separate BPS is stored here in this repository.

It requires [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) to build. If you have that installed, just run this shell command:

```bash
sh cook_rom.sh
```
