/\\This paradise is
Yoshi's Island,
where all the
Yoshies live.
They are all in an
uproar over the
baby that fell
from the sky.///

2
/\\Wait! The baby
seems to know
where he wants to
go ...
The bond between
the twins informs
each of them where
the other one is.
The Yoshies decide
to carry the baby
to his destination
via a relay system/3F
Now begins a new
adventure for the
Yoshies and baby
Mario.///

3
/\\If baby Mario falls
off Yoshi's back,
the Countdown
Timer will begin.
When it reaches 0,
Kamek's toadies
will kidnap baby
Mario!
The more Stars /Y*
you collect, the
safer you are.

The Countdown
Timer will slowly
count back up to
10.
Complete a stage
by passing baby
Mario to the next
Yoshi.///

/\\Yoshi can grab
bubbles with his
tongue and spit
them out some-
-where else.

inside!///

people will read
this message...///

11
/\\Seeds rebound
off a tulip at an
angle, and the
Slugger will hit
them when they
get near. Try to
get the red coin!///
