/\\This paradise is
Yoshi's Island,
where all the
Yoshies live.
They are all in an
uproar over the
baby that fell
from the sky.///

2
/\\Wait! The baby
seems to know
where he wants to
go ...
The bond between
the twins informs
each of them where
the other one is.
The Yoshies decide
to carry the baby
to his destination
via a relay system/3F
Now begins a new
adventure for the
Yoshies and baby
Mario.///

3
/\\If baby Mario falls
off Yoshi's back,
the Countdown
Timer will begin.
When it reaches 0,
Kamek's toadies
will kidnap baby
Mario!
The more Stars /Y*
you collect, the
safer you are.

The Countdown
Timer will slowly
count back up to
10.
Complete a stage
by passing baby
Mario to the next
Yoshi.///

4
/\\Yoshi can grab
bubbles with his
tongue and spit
them out some-
-where else.
Use this to reach
greater heights!///

5
/\\Salvo's locked his
castle up tight.
Find another way
inside!///

6
/\\WARNING: This
castle is full of
toxic gas.
Collect stars or
dive into water
to keep yourself
alive!///

7
/\\   Hovering Jump:
By holding /SB
down, you can
hover in the air
for a short time.
Make the extra
effort!///

8
/\\Jump and hold /SB
after pounding
the red platform
to avoid falling.
Also, if you see
a coin arrow,
shoot where it
points to! WHOA!///

9
/\\We at SMWCentral
poured all sorts
of stuff into
creating this hack
for your
entertainment.
It is full of
levels. Enjoy!///

10
/\\I wonder how many
people will read
this message...///

11
/\\Seeds rebound
off a tulip at an
angle, and the
Slugger will hit
them when they
get near. Try to
get the red coin!///

12
/\\Not handing over
the baby, are we?
I'll just crush
you flat then!///

13
/\\It's terribly
rude to break in,
you know ...
Salvo here will
have to teach you
a thing or two
about private
property!///

14
/\\It's over, Yoshi!
This thief prince
is about to steal
your life away!///

15
/\\Good news! You've
just won a one way
express ticket
to the MOON!///

16
/\\Little slug! Hear
me now! Chase
this pest to the
ends of the Earth!///

17
/\\Hi, Yoshi! I've
got an a-MAZE-ing
boss for-
Ah, forget it ...///

18
/\\You may think
you're tough, but
this Tap-Tap is
even tougher!///

19
/\\Don't worry,
I'm not going
to sing the
song ...///

20
/\\Well, Yoshi, it's
been a gas! But
this is the end
of the road!
After all, how
can you triumph
against a target
you can't hit?///

21
/\\So it's come to
this, then ...
It's time to face
you myself!///

22
/\\Ack, I woke up
the kid! Young
Master Bowser,
go back to bed!///

23
/\\Geez, Kamek!
Could you keep it
down? You're so
noisy!///

24
/\\Huh?
Who are you guys?


Were you an'
Kamek fighting?
I bet I could
beat you easy!


/TS/31LET'S


ROCK!!!///

25
/\\Well, Yoshi, it's
over. You win.
Are you satisfied
with yourself?
Just you wait!
We'll be back
when you least
expect it!///

26
/\\Yoshi, why did you
do this???
Young Master, let
me help you! Here!///
